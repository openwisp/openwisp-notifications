Changelog
=========

Version 1.1.0 [unreleased]
--------------------------

WIP

Version 1.0.3 [2022-08-03]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Flagged tests that should not be run on a production environment:
  These tests depend on the static storage backend of the project.
  In a production environment, the filenames could get changed due to
  static minification and cache invalidation. Hence, these tests
  should not be run on the production environment because they'll fail.

Version 1.0.2 [2022-07-01]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `hardcoded static image URLs
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications/issues/243>`_.
  These create issues when static files are served using an
  external service (e.g. S3 storage buckets).
- Fixed `"Organization.DoesNotExist" error on creating
  a new organization <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications/issues/238>`_.

Version 1.0.1 [2022-06-09]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `handling of the "OPENWISP_NOTIFICATIONS_SOUND" setting
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications/issues/239>`_.
  The code was not passing the sound file path to the utilities
  of ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` and hence the sound file was
  not loaded properly when using different static storage backend.

Version 1.0.0 [2022-04-28]
--------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Introduced mechanism to `clear cache on specific signals
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications#cache-invalidation>`_
