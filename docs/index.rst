Notifications
=============

OpenWISP Notifications is a versatile system designed to deliver email and
web notifications. Its primary function is to enable other OpenWISP
modules to alert users about significant events occurring within their
network. By seamlessly integrating with various OpenWISP components, it
ensures users are promptly informed about critical updates and changes.
This enhances the overall user experience by keeping network
administrators aware and responsive to important developments.
