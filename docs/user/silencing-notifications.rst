*OpenWISP Notifications* allows users to silence all notifications generated by
specific objects they are not interested in for a desired period of time or even permanently,
while other users will keep receiving notifications normally.

Using the widget on an object's admin change form, a user can disable all notifications
generated by that object for a day, week, month or permanently.

**Note**: This feature requires configuring
`"OPENWISP_NOTIFICATIONS_IGNORE_ENABLED_ADMIN" <#openwisp_notifications_ignore_enabled_admin>`_
to enable the widget in the admin section of the required models.
